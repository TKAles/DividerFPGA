@W: MT529 :"d:\icecube\dividerfpga\counter16.v":14:0:14:5|Found inferred clock top|laser_pulse which controls 19 sequential elements including pulse_counter.internal_count_reached. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
